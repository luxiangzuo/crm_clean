Our clients are asking for a landed quote.

We’ve handled similar lines before (Philips, Nihon Kohden re-sellers), so our channel is active. But we need to know how strict your MOQ and performance clauses are.\r\n\r\nIf we're investing in registration and launch, we’ll also need initial marketing materials (catalogs, demo videos, white-labeled brochures in Spanish if possible). Time is tight if we want to hit Q4.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're open to a call this week — I’m available Wed and Fri.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Ricardo Méndez\r\n Managing Director\r\n MedTrans Chile S.A.", "intent": "Requesting detailed pricing and sales expectations", "stage": "Opportunity", "model_used": "Gemini - models/gemini-1.5-pro"}

Please confirm what’s standard and what counts as optional. Also, what’s your MOQ to start a distributorship? If exclusivity is on the table, we’ll need some territorial protection, at least for Southern Cone countries.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: do you support Spanish-language manuals and packaging out of the box? If not, do you allow local adaptation?

If so, could you briefly outline what kind of interface or protocol is used? Our biomedical team raised this point regarding integration.\r\n\r\nAlso, just for planning purposes — should we move forward, what would be the estimated lead time for a 15-unit order to France (Île-de-France region)?

Our IT colleagues are also asking whether the monitors support SNMP alerts or syslog output — do let me know if that’s something available.\r\n\r\nFinally, just to double-check — is the evaluation unit already in transit, or is there a tracking reference available?\r\n\r\nThanks again for bearing with all our back-and-forth!

I understand that evaluation units are available for EU public institutions; would you kindly confirm the typical lead time and whether all logistics are arranged by Joja?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the VitalSure Compact is ultimately selected, how flexible is your invoicing structure for hospitals that operate under delayed reimbursement cycles?

I’ve reviewed them briefly and also discussed with my supervisor.\r\n\r\nWe have a few additional questions before we can include your products in our shortlist. First, could you clarify if the VitalSure Compact series includes any integrated connectivity to our existing EMR system (we use DxCare by Dedalus)? This will likely be important for our IT validation. Also, are there French language options for the interface or manuals? Not all departments are equally comfortable with English, especially in geriatrics.\r\n\r\nAnother small concern from our side: we noticed that your company is based in Shenzhen but the products are not available for mainland China. This was a bit confusing to our compliance officer. Is there a specific reason for this?\r\n\r\nLastly, could you please confirm whether you offer on-site installation support in France or if everything would be remote?
