Our clients are asking for a landed quote. Can you share a ballpark including shipping, assuming 50 units?\r\n\r\nAlso, please clarify what sales target you'd expect from a regional distributor like us. We’ve handled similar lines before (Philips, Nihon Kohden re-sellers), so our channel is active. But we need to know how strict your MOQ and performance clauses are.\r\n\r\nIf we're investing in registration and launch, we’ll also need initial marketing materials (catalogs, demo videos, white-labeled brochures in Spanish if possible). Time is tight if we want to hit Q4.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're open to a call this week — I’m available Wed and Fri.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Ricardo Méndez\r\n Managing Director\r\n MedTrans Chile S.A.", "intent": "Requesting pricing and distributorship details", "stage": "Opportunity", "model_used": "OpenAI - gpt-4o"}

Please confirm what’s standard and what counts as optional. Also, what’s your MOQ to start a distributorship? If exclusivity is on the table, we’ll need some territorial protection, at least for Southern Cone countries.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: do you support Spanish-language manuals and packaging out of the box? If not, do you allow local adaptation? We’re looking at a Q4 tender that may require 60–80 units as a first batch, so speed matters.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n Ricardo Méndez\r\n Managing Director\r\n MedTrans Chile S.A.", "intent": "Request for product pricing and distribution terms", "stage": "Opportunity", "model_used": "OpenAI - gpt-4o"}
