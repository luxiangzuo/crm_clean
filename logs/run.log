Subject: 关于 VitalSure S3 系列台湾区代理合作的初步咨询
Body:
Joja MedTech 团队您好，

我们公司 NeoMediTech Ltd.&nbsp;有意探索贵公司 VitalSure S3 系列&nbsp;在台湾市场的代理合作。我们曾代理过 迈瑞（Mindray）&nbsp;和 理邦（Edan）&nbsp;等品牌，在本地私人诊所与中小型医院拥有稳定渠道。

为评估合作可行性，烦请协助解答以下问题：


贵公司是否有针对首次合作代理的 价格阶梯或优惠方案？达成代理价是否有最低订单量（MOQ）或首批金额要求？



若出货至 台湾高雄港，能否提供一份 S3 Pro（50台）数量级的 CIF 报价？方便我们评估整体成本。



是否可以考虑 区域独占协议？若有，通常附带的业绩目标为何？



初期是否提供 样机与宣传支持资料？我们预计在明年第一季度展开本地化推广，可能需要中文手册与销售包。


感谢您的协助，如方便亦欢迎安排一次简短通话。

Subject: Inquiry for Regional Distribution C Chile
Body:
Dear Joja Team,

We are currently evaluating new monitoring solutions for our portfolio in Chile and came across your VitalSure and wireless modules via one of our client hospitals. The form factor looks promising for both private clinic settings and public tenders, but before we go deeper, I need to understand your distribution terms ― especially exclusivity conditions for LATAM and estimated dealer pricing per unit for 20C100 units monthly volume.

If you already have partners in Chile, please clarify which segments they cover, otherwise we’d be open to discussing a regional representation model, ideally with access to demo units and marketing co-funding. Lead times, warranty coverage, and logistics from Asia are also relevant here, but first let’s talk about price.

Subject: Re: Next Steps for Chilean Market Launch
Body:
Appreciate the response.

Still waiting for the CIF Santiago pricing ― not just FOB. Our clients are asking for a landed quote. Can you share a ballpark including shipping, assuming 50 units?

Also, please clarify what sales target you'd expect from a regional distributor like us. We’ve handled similar lines before (Philips, Nihon Kohden re-sellers), so our channel is active. But we need to know how strict your MOQ and performance clauses are.

If we're investing in registration and launch, we’ll also need initial marketing materials (catalogs, demo videos, white-labeled brochures in Spanish if possible). Time is tight if we want to hit Q4.

Let me know if you're open to a call this week ― I’m available Wed and Fri.

Subject: Re: Distribution Terms & Pricing C Chile
Body:
Thanks for the clarification.

If we’re talking about FOB Shenzhen, then we’ll need an estimate that includes full set (monitor, cables, SPO2/NIBP accessories) ― not just the base unit. Please confirm what’s standard and what counts as optional. Also, what’s your MOQ to start a distributorship? If exclusivity is on the table, we’ll need some territorial protection, at least for Southern Cone countries.

One more thing: do you support Spanish-language manuals and packaging out of the box? If not, do you allow local adaptation? We’re looking at a Q4 tender that may require 60C80 units as a first batch, so speed matters.
